This is a dev document to keep track of things completed and to complete.

I'm starting this doc midway and will start documenting from there.

*********************************************************************************

Complete:
    - code structuring
    - reading and interpreting ELF file for Linux on amd64
    - runtime memory structure
To do:
    - extensive research on exactly how amd64 arch executes its instructions
    - research about the register architecture of amd64
    - implement Amd64::Instruction class which has access to registers and memory, and perform actions according to the binary sequence that is pointed to by PC


- Use "gcc main.c -o run -no-pie -O0" to guarantee compiling test programs to an executable with no optimization
- Use "objdump -S run" to disassemble executable
